                    <h3 id="rules-text">#GRIDLIFE TrackBattle is a multi-event time attack series taking place at road courses throughout the North Americas. Time attack is not wheel to wheel racing.  Drivers are competing against the clock to see which cars and which drivers are the fastest over the course of a weekend.</h3>
                    <h3 id="rules-text">The #GRIDLIFE TrackBattle is about providing safe, spirited, fun and competitive track足time for advanced and expert drivers. TrackBattle is open to all makes and models and all drive train layouts: rear wheel drive (RWD), front wheel drive (FWD), and all wheel drive (AWD). #GRIDLIFE TrackBattle includes competitive classes for all degrees of tuning and modification.</h3>
                    <h3 id="rules-text">#GRIDLIFE TrackBattle is about safety and fun first. We run a simplified rule set that makes it easy for long time HPDE drivers to make the transition to competitive driving without the complexities and costs of your typical sanctioning bodies.</h3>
                    <h3 id="rules-text">Our classing system is designed to place vehicles of similar type and drivetrain into competitive groups based on modifications and ultimately the potential lap time of the vehicle.</h3>
                    <h3 id="rules-text">The final classification of your vehicle will be determined by the organizers and may potentially be adjusted between events to keep events exciting and competitive throughout the duration of the #GRIDLIFE season.</h3>
